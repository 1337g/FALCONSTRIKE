## TO-DO
This is an alpha release version and depending on the response many more upgrades to existing functionalities are coming soon.

Some of them are:

1. Integrate various Sandbox detection algorithms.
1. Integrate support for more stealthy shellcode injection techniques.
1. Integrate function obfuscation to make it stealthier.
1. Include a network component to callback to a C2 when a Stage-2 payload is released or to change targets/payloads and other options on-the-fly etc.

Feel free to communicate any further feature that you want to see in the next release. Suggestions for improving existing features are also warmly welcome :)
